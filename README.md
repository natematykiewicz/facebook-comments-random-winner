# facebook-comments-random-winner

## Description:
Choose a random commenter from a post on Facebook.

## Installation:
1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) browser plugin. Tampermonkey allows you to install scripts that run when you visit a specified website. This allows you to customize your experience when visiting the site. *Please use discretion when installing scripts, as they can be malicious. Only install scripts from sources you trust.*
2. Visit https://raw.githubusercontent.com/natematykiewicz/facebook-comments-random-winner/master/facebook-comments-random-winner.user.js and you will be prompted to install the script.
3. Click Install. The window will close and install the script. (Updates to the script will be installed automatically.)

## Usage:
On Facebook, pull up any post that you'd like to choose a random winner for. In the top right, of the page (be sure to scroll to the top) you'll see a "Random Drawing" button. Click this button. You'll be prompted with a few questions, to know the rules of the drawing.

In order to choose a random comment as a winner, the script will click the "View previous comments" and view additional replies links, until all comments/replies are visible on your computer screen. This process can take a while, so be patient with it.

Once all of the comments are loaded, it will pick a winner. If you have multiple winners to choose, you can just click the button again. (This time around, it will be very fast, since all comments are loaded already.)
